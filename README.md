# Cr3nroll
Pronounced: *(cr-enroll)*</br></br>

A general enrollment manager script for ChromeOS</br>
I'm going to actively maintain this with the latest public unenrollment too, and be adding more features whenever I can.</br>

feel free to put this into any other project, as long as OSmium ([CrOSmium](https://github.com/CrOSmium/)) is properly credited (by leaving the unmodified credits in the script)
