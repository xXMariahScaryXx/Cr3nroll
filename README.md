# Cr3nroll
Pronounced: *(CR-enroll)*</br></br>

A general enrollment manager script for ChromeOS</br>
I'm going to actively maintain this with the latest avaliable unenrollment* too, and be adding more features whenever I can.</br>
**shim <u>only</u>*

----------
feel free to put this into any other project, as long as OSmium (crosmium) is properly credited (by leaving the unmodified credits in the script)
